# Stillroot Ghost Drops

Welcome to **Stillroot Ghost Drops** — a quiet collection of minimalist mental survival guides for those who are quietly waking up in a world that feels noisy and overwhelming.

## What are Ghost Drops?

Ghost Drops are brief, distilled signals meant to help you find **stillness, clarity, and rootedness** amid chaos.  
They are not loud calls to action or grand manifestos, but subtle nudges — tools for reflection and self-observation.

## Why Stillroot?

*Stillroot* represents the inner calm, the quiet strength of a deeply grounded root system holding firm beneath the surface, no matter the storm.  
This collection is built to honor that resilience.

## How to Use This Repo

- Each Ghost Drop is a standalone guide, numbered and dated.  
- Read them slowly and privately.  
- Use them as prompts to reflect and observe your own mental landscape.  
- Share thoughtfully with those who seek quiet clarity.
