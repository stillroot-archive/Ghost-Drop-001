**Stillness in the Noise**  
*A mental survival guide for the quietly awake*

### 1. The Crack

What you're feeling is normal.  
Anxious about the future.  
Something is not working anymore.  
What's going on?  
It's recognition.

Accept that feeling.  
Let it stew.  
Don't be afraid.

### 2. What You Must Remember

You are not alone.  
You are alive.  
You are thinking.  
You are breathing.  
You are human.

### 3. Mental Tools to Anchor You

**Tool 1: Who are you?**  
"You were taught to be what you are.  
But have you ever asked yourself?"

**Tool 2: What do I want?**  
"Amidst the confusion, is this truly?"

**Tool 3: Slow is not wrong**  
"What's the hurry?"

**Tool 4: Clarity**  
"Use it as a compass."

### 4. What To Do Now

- Write down what you notice — privately.  
- Listen to your heart, listen to that voice. Keep listening.  
- Take honest accountability.  
- Practice silent observation of yourself. Feel the emergence.

### 5. What Not To Do

- Don't look for shortcuts.  
- Don't turn away from yourself.  
- Don't chase other people's truth.  
- Don't rush.

Be still, like a root.
